Pynesweeper V1.0 by Andrew Shirley

The classic game of Minesweeper but made for the console, using Python and Textual.

Who says Sys Admins can't have fun? Here's a fun game to play from your Windows Terminal or via an SSH session with your favourite Linux distribution.

The idea was born from a love of the game and to sharpen my skills at Python and Textual.

Simply download the Executable and execute from a Windows Terminal. (Bash Version coming soon)

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and run the game from the main folder with:

**Windows:**
run.bat

Best used from a Command Prompt in a Windows Terminal: Press Windows-Key, type "Terminal"
